# Example snippet for the parent gateway (listening on host port 8000)
# Attach this nginx to the shared network 'app404_net' so it can reach the team8 gateway service by hostname 'gateway'.
#
#   upstream team8_gateway { server gateway:80; }
#   server {
#     listen 8000;
#     location /team8/       { proxy_pass http://team8_gateway$request_uri; }
#     location /team8/api/   { proxy_pass http://team8_gateway$request_uri; }
#     location /team8/ai/    { proxy_pass http://team8_gateway$request_uri; }
#     location /team8-media/ { proxy_pass http://team8_gateway$request_uri; }
#   }
